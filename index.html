          Linus Torvalds is the creator and the main developer of the Linux
          kernel, which is used by Linux distributions like Ubuntu and other OS
          like Android. He also developed the most popular version control
          system Git. Torvalds developed the Linux OS in the early 1990s. The
          mascot he chose for Linux was a penguin named Tux, which is now very
          popular. Linux is now on everything, from computers to smartphones to
          servers to cars and so on. Linux powers 100% of the supercomputers in
          the world. In addition to Linux, Torvalds also developed the
          revolutionary version control system called “Git”, which has helped
          many developers shape a better workflow. He is also known to create
          Subsurface, a scuba diving logging software. In 2000, Time Magazine
          listed Linus Torvalds as 17th in their Time 100: The Most Important
          People of the Century. He was awarded with the IEEE Masaru Ibuka
          Consumer Electronics Award in 2018 for his leadership of the
          development and proliferation of Linux. An asteroid named 9793
          Torvalds was named after him.
